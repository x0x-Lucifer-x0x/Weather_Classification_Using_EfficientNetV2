# Weather Detection Model 

This project presents a **weather image classification model** developed using PyTorch and EfficientNetV2-S. It's designed to accurately identify various weather conditions (such as clear, cloudy, foggy, or rainy) from images through a **deep learning approach**. The model has been rigorously trained and evaluated on the [Weather Image Recognition dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset).

## Features

  * **Weather Classification:** Detects various weather conditions (clear, cloudy, foggy, rainy, etc.) in images.
  * **Deep Learning Powered:** Utilizes a PyTorch-based EfficientNetV2-S model for high accuracy.
  * **Kaggle Dataset:** Trained and validated on the comprehensive Weather Image Recognition dataset.

## Setup Instructions

### Run Locally (PC)

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/x0x-Lucifer-x0x/Weather_Classification_Using_EfficientNetV2.git
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Download Dataset:**
    Download the [Weather Image Recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset) from Kaggle and extract its contents into a directory of your choice (e.g., `data/weather_dataset`).
4.  **Download Trained Model Weights:**
    Download the pre-trained model weights (`efficientnet_v2_s_weather.pth`) from the [Download Trained Model](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23download-trained-model) section below. Save this file in your project root directory or update the `model_path` variable in your script to its location.
5.  **Configure Paths:**
    Update the `data_dir` and `model_path` variables in your Python scripts (e.g., `train.py`, `inference.py`) to point to the correct locations of your dataset and model weights.

### Run on Google Colab

For a cloud-based setup, use Google Colab:

1.  **Open a New Notebook:** Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create a new Python 3 notebook.
2.  **Install Packages:** Run the following command in a Colab cell to install necessary libraries:
    ```python
    !pip install torch torchvision opendatasets kagglehub
    ```
3.  **Download Dataset:** Use the Kaggle API to download the dataset directly into your Colab environment:
    ```python
    import kagglehub

    # Download latest version of the dataset
    path = kagglehub.dataset_download("jehanbhathena/weather-dataset")

    print("Path to dataset files:", path)
    ```
4.  **Upload Model Weights:** Upload the `efficientnet_v2_s_weather.pth` file directly to your Colab session, or mount your Google Drive and navigate to the model file's location.
5.  **Update Paths:** Adjust any file paths in your Colab notebook code to reflect the locations of the dataset and model weights within the Colab environment.

## Model Details

## Inference Example

### Visualization of Predictions

Below is a sample prediction result grid generated by the model. Each image displays its true and predicted labels, with color indicating the correctness of the prediction.
